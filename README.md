# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
"A Python-based Credit Card Fraud Detection System that analyzes transaction patterns, detects anomalies, and prevents unauthorized transactions using machine learning techniques and rule-based security measures."
🚀 Project Goal:
A Python-based security system designed to detect and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions using EDA, anomaly detection, and rule-based security checks.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Two-Factor Authentication (OTP verification) for secure admin access.
✅ Transaction Fraud Detection based on predefined security rules.
✅ Anomaly Detection for identifying unusual spending behaviors.
✅ Machine Learning Techniques for predicting high-risk transactions.
✅ Data Visualization using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).

💡 Tech Stack Used:

Python (pandas, numpy, TextBlob, Plotly Express)
Data Preprocessing & EDA
Anomaly Detection Algorithms
Feature Engineering
Machine Learning for Fraud Classification (Optional)
📊 Project Findings:
Fraudulent transactions show unique patterns that can be detected using statistical models and machine learning. This project highlights how data-driven security solutions can minimize financial losses.
